✅ Moderation Prompt: Detecting Spam & Advertisement in the Xbox Gaming Community

Use this guide to consistently identify content that qualifies as spam or advertisement, while distinguishing it from genuine community engagement.

📌 Definition

Spam and Advertisement refer to unsolicited or irrelevant content that aims to promote products, services, social media accounts, or external links—rather than contributing to authentic gaming discussion.

This includes both direct promotions and indirect self-promotion that disrupts the community’s experience.

🧩 Main Concepts (With Examples)

1. Commercial Intent
Content created primarily to drive revenue, subscriptions, traffic, or followers—often unrelated to genuine discussion. This includes direct sales, affiliate links, paid services, and monetized content promotion.
- Example: “Get the best gaming chair for 30% off at ProGamerChairs.com!”
- Example: “Use my promo code STREAMER50 for discounts on all gaming gear!”

2. Repetition and Disruption
Posting the same or similar promotional messages across multiple threads, channels, or time periods, especially if off-topic or intrusive to active conversations.
- Example: Posting the same “Check out my stream at twitch.tv/streamername!” in multiple threads within an hour.
- Example: Copy-pasting promotional content in different unrelated game channels.

3. Deceptive or Clickbait Practices
Content that misleads users into engaging, including fake giveaways, exaggerated claims, and attention-grabbing messages that don’t deliver value.
- Example: “Click here for a free Xbox Series X! No catch!” (leads to scam site)
- Example: “100% working method to get free game coins – limited time!”

4. Excessive Self-Promotion
Sharing personal content—such as Twitch streams, YouTube channels, or Discord servers—without meaningful participation or contribution to community discussions.
- Example: “New gameplay video on my channel – subscribe now!” (with no other interaction)
- Example: User only posts links to their own content without engaging in any discussions.

5. Irrelevant Link Dumping
Posting links to videos, products, websites, or social media accounts with little to no context, especially if not related to the conversation or thread.
- Example: Dropping a YouTube link in a post about a bug report with no context.
- Example: Sharing a personal website in a strategy thread unrelated to the topic.

6. Unsolicited Direct Messaging
Sending promotional messages or links directly to users via DM, especially for the purpose of selling services, asking for subscriptions, or promoting third-party platforms.
- Example: “Hey! Want to grow your Twitch followers fast? DM me.”
- Example: Sending links to personal content to random users via private messages.

7. Affiliate or Referral Schemes
Sharing referral codes, affiliate links, or pyramid-style promotional content disguised as advice or recommendations.
- Example: “Join this game using my referral code ABC123 to get bonuses!”
- Example: “Earn cash by referring others to this game platform. Sign up through my link!”

8. Mass Tagging or Mentioning
Tagging multiple users or using @everyone/@here in a way that promotes personal or commercial content, particularly when it's not event-related or community-driven.
- Example: “@everyone join my live stream now!” (in non-event or unrelated contexts)
- Example: Tagging 10+ users to promote your YouTube video.

9. Fake Engagement Requests
Asking users to like, follow, share, or subscribe in exchange for perks, shoutouts, or giveaways—especially when not related to a broader community effort.
- Example: “Like and share this post to win free V-Bucks!”
- Example: “First 10 followers get a special shoutout!”

10. Off-Topic Advertisements
Promoting unrelated services, products, or content (e.g., crypto schemes, unrelated merch, non-gaming YouTube channels) in gaming discussions.
- Example: “Buy crypto and win gaming loot – link in bio!”
- Example: “Check out my eCommerce store – now selling gaming hoodies!”

✅ Exclusions (Allowed Content)

These types of content are not considered spam or advertisement and should generally be allowed:

- Discussions about in-game currency, items, or rewards within the context of gameplay
  Example: “Anyone grinding gold for the weekend quest?”

- Requests for team-ups, co-op partners, or tournament squads
  Example: “Need 2 more players for Ranked – anyone available?”

- Sharing personal accomplishments or gameplay highlights
  Example: “Just hit Diamond rank in Halo – what a grind!”

- Asking for gameplay help, bug fixes, or performance advice
  Example: “Anyone else getting FPS drops after the last update?”

- Event announcements without monetization
  Example: “Hosting a free-for-all tournament this weekend – everyone welcome!”

- Limited and contextual self-promotion, when it adds value to an ongoing discussion
  Example: “I made a short video explaining how to beat this boss – hope it helps!”

Let’s keep the Xbox community respectful, relevant, and spam-free!
